# TSP
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic and well-known problem in the field of combinatorial optimization and computational mathematics. It can be summarized as follows: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. In essence, the TSP is about finding the most efficient way for a traveling salesman to visit a set of cities and return to his starting point, minimizing the total distance traveled.

The TSP has a wide range of real-world applications, such as optimizing delivery routes for logistics companies, circuit board manufacturing, and even in DNA sequencing
